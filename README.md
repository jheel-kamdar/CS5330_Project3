# **Object Recognition System - README**

## **Project Information**
**Project Title:** Object Recognition System Using Image Processing and Classification  
**Group Members (if any):** Adit Shah & Jheel Kamdar
**Submission Date:** 20 February 2025

## **Project Overview**
This project implements an **object recognition system** using **OpenCV and C++**. The system processes **real-time video streams and static images** to detect, segment, and classify objects. The classification methods include **Nearest-Neighbor Recognition, Decision Trees, and Depth-Based Segmentation**. Additionally, the system **automatically learns new objects**, expanding the database dynamically.
